# How to contribute

The files in this repository are primarily used as a showcase project. As such, I would appreciate contributions be limited in scope to improving code readability/styling, suggestions for improvements to game play/feature requests, and bug fixes (though I'd prefer to have the issue raised for me to fix.)
